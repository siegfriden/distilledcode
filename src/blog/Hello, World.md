Hi. This is my very first blog post. I want to briefly introduce the blog itself, its origin and purpose.

## Why this blog exists

I made this blog on a whim one day. I was inspired by a coworker who started his own tech blog a year ago. I decided I wanted to have one too. I’ve always enjoyed experimenting with tech stacks, from web frameworks to cloud platforms. I love to iterate and optimize things. Through this blog, I want to record and share the results of my explorations.

## Why "Distilled Code"

I spent a lot of time thinking about what my blog name should be. Finding a decent name was hard because many of the ".com" domains were taken. I forgot how I arrived at "Distilled Code", but I resonated with it immediately.

"Distilled" implies a clean and pure substance, carefully separated from the noise. I believe it fits well with the purpose of this blog. It also ties back to my time as an undergrad student, where I did chemical distillations in the lab.

## The road ahead

This blog started as one of my casual projects. I don’t know where or how far it will go, but I hope that having it published can motivate me and hold me accountable to keep learning.

I will minimize the use of AI in my posts. I want to develop my writing skills along the way so I can articulate my thoughts better over time.

This is a blog I write to express my passion to the world. I want it to be a record of "me", a reflection of my knowledge and personality.
