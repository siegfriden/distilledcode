It's been exactly one month since I published my first post. My second post was supposed to be a tutorial on how I built my blog. It was originally scheduled to be released around September end, but it got delayed due to various things.

Writing a tutorial post turned out to be much harder than I thought. There were lots of small, simple steps that normally could have been done in minutes, but took hours to translate into a beginner-friendly guide.

I was also spending a lot of mental energy trying to do everything perfectly. I was afraid of messing things up, which was expected when we're doing things for the first time. When the post was half finished, my self-doubt had piled so high that no amount of motivation could push me through. Each writing session became me just staring at the screen, wondering where I went wrong.

So there are two things that needs to be fixed here.

First, I decided to rewrite it from scratch. I won't be doing any tutorials. Instead, I'll be sharing the resources and inspirations I used to make this blog, along with my thoughts on the process. I think this approach will be a better use of time for myself and for anyone reading. There are already plenty of excellent resources out there that cover the basics better than I cloud.

Second, it is important that my rewrite doesn't fall into the same trap. I'll do my best to embrace imperfection. I'll accept that the writing is going to be messy and awkward, maybe even incomplete. Being bad is an unavoidable phase of learning. But at least I'll ship something -- that's progress.

I expect the post to be ready by next Saturday.
